    "title": "Non-steady state modeling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Modeling stomatal conductance (gs) is a key challenge in vegetation models and land surface models, and various approaches have been developed including statistics- and optimality-based models. The stomatal model is typically used along with the canopy radiative model, which provides the former with necessary inputs like photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature (T) to compute photosynthesis and then gs. In model world practice, gs is typically computed at a steady state, meaning that model parameters (such as photosynthetic rate [A], transpiration rate (E), gs, PAR, and T) agree numerically. This assumption is fine for most models as their canopy models are simple enough and the computation resource required to derive the steady state is low.\nHowever, finding a similar steady state for complicated canopy models as in CliMA Land is overwhelming. For example, any change in gs would lead to changes in A and E, and thus leaf latend heat flux, leaf temperature, longwave radiation, hydraulic profiles, etc.\nMoreover, the steady-state assumption could break the mass and energy conservation. If leaf water content and heat capacity are considered, but the final water and heat flux are all at steady state, then how do we account for the changes in water mass and total energy?\nMost importantly, the soil-plant-air continuum in nature will NEVER be at a steady state, say the sun is moving all the time, wind is randomly changing leaf positions, soil water contents are changing, and plant physiology is responding. For all these reasons, we’d better model the land surface processes prognostically.\nIn the recent research led by Ke Liu (Liu et al., 2024; Biogeosciences), we evaluated the impacts of modeling gs at non-steady state using CliMA Land. We found that, as stomata open “slowly” (compared to immediately at steady state), gs would be lower than steady state models in the morning time in an ideal environment without cloud. Comparatively, as stomata close “slowly”, gs would be higher than the steady-state assumption in the afternoon in the ideal environment. In this case, these differences could cancel out, but it still suggested that modelers had messed up the timing. Notably, the natural environment is never ideal following a sine or cosine function, and plants are experiencing random fluctuations in radiation, dry air, etc. These resulted in elevated differences between steady-state and non-steady-state modeling (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Difference between modeled carbon and water fluxes under steady and non-steady states.\n\n\nThere are many benefits for models to take the non-steady state approach, particularly that it is more realistic! There are also more implications from the study, please check out the paper for more details. Yet, there are still a lot of problems to resolve in the future, such as\n\nHow to best represent the prognostic gs (other formulations)?\nDo plants have different time constants when opening and closing the stomata?\nDo sunlit and shaded leaves have different time constants?\n\nI am keen to see follow-up studies that address these problems. Together, we can make the vegetation and land surface models more realistic."

    "text": "Researchers are spending way too much time in finding, formatting, and reusing public data. The ever increasing amount of data, various forms of data, and different layouts of data make this problem even more serious. While the intention of sharing data within the community is to promote future research, the increasing fragmentation makes it harder and harder for researchers to find and reuse them, particularly for newbies. Taking my personal experience as an example, to collect the global datasets for the CliMA Land Model, we spent weeks and months to identify which datasets to use, download the data from different sources, standardize the datasets, and learn how to read the datasets correctly with different formats (such as NetCDF, GeoTIFF, CSV, and binary) with different programming languages. Unfortunately, researchers may need to repeat this tedious work again and again, even for the same datasets (if one forgot where the data is stored or how it has been processed).\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Pathway to assemble and distribute the GriddingMachine database.\n\n\nAiming towards minimizing the effort involved in the data reuse, we started the GriddingMachine project by\n\nCollecting the data from various sources,\nProcessing the data to a uniform format (NetCDF),\nStoring the reprocessed data on a public server, and\nDistributing the datasets via different programming languages.\n\nEach dataset is labeled with a unique tag that describes\n\nType of the dataset (e.g., leaf area index, biomass, and etc.),\nSpatial resolution (e.g., 5X means 0.2° × 0.2° grid),\nTemporal resolution (e.g., 1Y means 1 year, 1M means 1 month),\nYear of the data, and\nVersion of the data (from different publications).\n\nOne can simply look up the available dataset tags (and suggest new datasets) through our Github repository.\nWith the unique tag, one can query the data directly via function query_collection, for example\nquery_collection(\"LAI_MODIS_2X_8D_2020\")\nfor the global leaf area index of the year 2020, and the dataset will be downloaded automatically. Alternatively, one can query data only for a site using the latitude and longitude without downloading the dataset, for example,\nrequest_LUT(\"LAI_MODIS_2X_8D_2020_V1\", 34.1478, -118.1445)\nfor the leaf area index of the year 2020 at Pasadena, CA, USA. See our published work (Wang et al., 2022) and online documentation for more information about how to use GriddingMachine. It supports Julia, Matlab, Octave, Python, and R.\nGriddingMachine makes it way easier to reuse the community-based datasets, as users are waived from data collection, formatting, and management. Given the aims of GriddingMachine, we welcome the contributions of globally gridded data to our collection."

Thus, there is increasing demand for a uniform tool to evaluate these approaches. One solution is to combine the agricultural practices with vegetation modeling to help explore the possible combinations of approaches to advance the crop yield. Here, we reviewed the trials and practices that aim to improve crop yield through light use at different stages.\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Strategies that can be used to improve crop yield through canopy radiation optimization.\n\n\nFor example, one can\n\noptimize chlorophyll content to improve the light condition in the lower canopy,\nimplement chlorophyll d and f to increase the near infrared light absorption,\noptimize crop density and space to improve light condition in the lower canopy,\nmix crop to maximize light absorption in the lower canopy, and\noptimize the supplemental light spectra and power.\n\nWe used CliMA Land to quantitatively evaluate the potentials of the proposed approaches, and thus that of vegetation modeling. This work has recently been published in the Crop and Environment (doi:10.1016/j.crope.2023.07.003). We believe that future efforts in advancing vegetation modeling and bridging it to agriculture will better guide real-world agricultural practices."

If you are familiar with the “Project.toml” file to manage the dependency packages, you can add a line in the [compat] field, such as\nGriddingMachine = \"=0.2.8\"\nThis will constrain the version to exactly v0.2.8. See https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/compatibility/ for more details about how to best utilize “Project.toml” file to manage the Julia environment.\nAlternatively, users can install the specific versions when install the package through REPL:\npkg&gt; add GriddingMachine#v0.2.8\nThis command will use install GriddingMachine v0.2.8 branch as a static dependency. This is different from changing the “Project.toml” file.\nSimilarly, if you want to install a specific branch, such as the main branch and my development branch wyujie, you can do that by adding “#branchname” when installing GriddingMachine through the pkg environment:\npkg&gt; add GriddingMachine#branchname\nNote that you can use “Project.toml” and the specific branch at the same time. However, as the target version is not yet registered, you will need to include “Manifest.toml” file as well to make your project environment a static one."

    "text": "Climate model predictions of future land carbon sink strength show significant discrepancies. To enhance predictive accuracy and reduce inter-model disagreements, it is crucial to improve the representation of vegetation processes and calibrate the models using more observational data. However, the limitations of computational resources in the past have hindered the integration of new theories and advances into traditional climate models, which often rely on statistical models to parameterize vegetation processes instead of mechanistic and physiological models (such as stomatal control models). Additionally, the preference for faster models has limited the incorporation of complex features (e.g., canopy model complexity), restricting the predictive skills of climate models.\nThe use of simple vegetation parameterization schemes in traditional climate and land surface models has also limited the types of data that could be used for model calibration. For example, existing climate models do not use complex canopy radiative transfer models, thus being limited to use data such as carbon, water, and energy fluxes for calibration, often from flux towers. Despite the high temporal resolution provided by flux towers, the towers’ sparsity in space and time is a major limitation. Remote sensing data from space (such as MODIS, TROPOMI, and OCO 2/3), which provide global coverage, or field data (such as PhotoSpec), which provide high spectral and temporal resolution, cannot be directly harnessed by the traditional models.\nIn CliMA, we are developing a next-generation climate model that learns from data. In pursuit of this goal, the land model component of CliMA seeks to equip the model with improved representations of vegetation processes and the capacity to directly harness remote sensing data, beyond just carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the land team, we have successfully developed a first version of the next-generation land surface model—CliMA Land.\nCliMA Land is a cutting-edge, highly modular model, entirely written in Julia, with all of its submodules available as standalone packages for use in research from leaf level to regional and global scales (Fig. 1 biophysics module of CliMA Land). The biophysics component of CliMA Land boasts an impressive array of features, including support for two canopy radiative transfer schemes (broadband and hyperspectral), a sophisticated plant hydraulic model (offering both steady and non-steady state options), and nine stomatal models (including both empirical and optimality-based models). Further details, code, examples, and documentation can be found at https://github.com/CliMA/Land.\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Diagram of CliMA Land biophysics module hierarchy.\n\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that we have successfully run a global simulation using CliMA Land for the first time. The model showed very high predictive skills with regard to simulated quantities such as gross primary productivity, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and canopy reflectance properties (as shown in Fig. 2). Although the model has not yet been calibrated based on field- or space-based data, it demonstrated impressive spatial and temporal predictions (mean R2 = 0.78 for nine simulated flux and remote sensing quantities). This work has recently been published in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (doi:10.1029/2021MS002964).\nWe continue to work on improving the model’s predictive skills through development, configuration, and calibration efforts. Furthermore, we are dedicated to keeping the model open-source and user-friendly, and thus warmly welcome contributions and suggestions from the community.\n\n\n\nFig. 2 Overview of CliMA Land simulations (before model calibration)."

    "title": "Using GPS for research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the 2020 KISS workshop, when Dr. Vincent Humphrey first presented his result to correlate GPS signals to canopy water content, I was fascinated by the findings. We are using GPS all the time, whether recognizing it or not. One thing clear is that when we are directly exposed to the sky, we have good GPS signals; and when we are sheltered by anything, we get weak signals. So, can we make use of the signals to estimate the things surrounding us, like trees? The short answer is YES!\nWhen installing one GPS receiver at the top of the canopy and one at the bottom, the signal difference is then fully attributed to the canopy (and canopy airspace) in between. Should any change in the differential signal, it is due to the canopy (and canopy airspace). With this technique, we should be expecting to see the diurnal and seasonal changes in the differential signals, which reflect the changes in the canopy.\nThe microwave signal used by GPS satellites can well penetrate through the atmosphere but still gets absorbed by molecules like water. Therefore, any change in canopy water content would lead to changes in the differential GPS signal. However, as the differential signals are also impacted by the atmosphere (like weather) and satellites (raw signal and satellite position), they are transformed to a unitless vegetation optical depth (VOD) to describe the canopy. In this case, when the canopy water content is high, VOD is high (equivalent to a thicker canopy).\nMany factors could impact the VOD retrieved from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), including but not limited to\n\nLeaf/Stem area index,\nLeaf/Stem water content,\nLeaf/Stem biomass, and\nCanopy structure.\n\nFor example, higher leaf area index and water content lead to higher VOD, and higher biomass leads to higher VOD. As leaf and stem biomass are not supposed to change dramatically in a day (unless due to leaf shedding), we can utilize the GNSS VOD to estimate the canopy water content dynamics. Season-wise, the GNSS VOD can be used to decode leaf area index dynamics as stem biomass is not changing substantially. Further, as the canopy is not fully closed as if it is a cloud of leaves, we should be expecting to see signal variation at different satellite viewing angles.\nIn the most recent paper by Yitong Yao (Yao et al., 2024; Geophysical Research Letters), we used the pair of GNSS receivers deployed at the Ozark flux tower site to see how the GNSS VOD data can be utilized to maximally exploit its potential. We did find that the VOD changed in a diurnal cycle, in a seasonal cycle, and with satellite position, showing great potential in estimating canopy water content and biomass. Surprisingly and also as expected as well, the VOD noise was related to precipitation, which is equivalent to increasing leaf water content, meaning it can also be used to “see” the weather!\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Seaonal GNSS VOD, LAI, and weather.\n\n\nThe GNSS VOD not only can be used to invert not canopy water content, its time series can also be used to to estimate transpiration rate (site-level calibration required). When coupled to sap flux measurements, the results would be useful to quantify the exact amount of water in the canopy. For more details, please check out the paper and Yitong’s blog.\nI can see the great potential of the technique being more sophisticated and being used at more places across the globe, say at each flux tower site, and on the campus. Imagine that one day, we can install two cell phones or watches to log the GNSS signals. But better to use the waterproofed ones."
