I can see the flowers every day\
Binded to a red "STOP ALL WAY"\
Seems to be a unforgettable price to pay\
But by a wrong jogger off the walkway\

Some cry for the bedtime story\
Some lose their amatory\
Some dig the albums for memory\
Yet, some claim innocense as victory\

Few prunes the trees in December\
But we all need visuals to remember\
While 35 is a default number\
Only slow traffic would encumber\

The dusts, the stones, and the rocks\
The grass, the shrubs, and the hemlocks\
The flies, the parrots, and the peacocks\
The xings, the streets, and the blocks\

People barely count to three not to say seven\
For all STOPs besides Allen\
Rules that remembered and then forgortten\
Rules that blur lower world and heaven\
