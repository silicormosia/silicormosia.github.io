The Collector module within [GriddingMachine.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/GriddingMachine.jl){target="_blank"} is designed to download the datasets to local drive and manage the downloaded datasets.

Each of the dataset in GriddingMachine is assigned a unique tag, such as **VCMAX_2X_1Y_V1**. Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/CliMA/GriddingMachine.jl/issues/62){target="_blank"} for all the supported datasets and their tags.


## Query the datasets (v0.3)
Function **download_artifact!** is designed to automatically download the dataset if not yet downloaded and then return to the user the path of the downloaded dataset:

- `download_artifact!(artname::String)` queries the dataset using the full tag of a dataset.

For example:
```
julia> using GriddingMachine.Collector: download_artifact!
julia> dsfile = download_artifact!("VCMAX_2X_1Y_V1")
```


## Clean the database (v0.3)
Function **clean_database!** is designed to clean the downloaded datasets, and there are three methods to use it:

- `clean_database!(selection::String="old")` to clean only the outdated (default) or all datasets (set selection to "all");
- `clean_database!(selection::Vector{String})` to clean the datasets using their tags;

Typically, it is only recommended to clean only the outdated datasets
```
julia> using GriddingMachine.Collector: clean_database!
julia> clean_database!();
```


## Sync the database (v0.3)
Sometimes, users may want to download all the datasets, for example, when building a server for the Requester module. In this case, we provide a function **sync_collections!**, which supoorts two methods:

- `sync_database!()` to download all the datasets within all collections;

And it is simple to perform the synchronization (**Note: do not try this code unless you really want to download all the data!**):
```
julia> using GriddingMachine.Collector: sync_database!
julia> sync_database!();
```
