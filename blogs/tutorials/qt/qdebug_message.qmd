Yesterday, I removed some packages from Linux, or something else happened... The outcome was that I could not see any qDebug() messages any longer in the tab "Application Output" of Qt Creator. I did not know to date what triggered the issue. It might be because of my switching to KDE Plasma from Cinnamon, but I do not bother to install Cinnamon back...

After searching for potential solutions for quite a while, I came across this: [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=259035](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=259035){target="_blank"}. According to d_fajardo, we can change the setting of Qt Creator. Since I am using Qt 6, I adapted the changes to
```
Qt Creator > Edit > Preferences... > Kits
```
Then in the Kits tab, you will find a few kits, such as Python 3.13.2 in auto detected and Desktop (default) in Manual...

If you click Desktop (default), for example, you will find
```
Environment: Edit Build Environment... Edit Run Environment...
```
Then change the build and run environments, and add the line 
```
QT_ASSUME_STDERR_HAS_CONSOLE=1
```

Now, you will have the qDebug() information back!
