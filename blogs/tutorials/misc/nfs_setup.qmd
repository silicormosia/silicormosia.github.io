## On the server
### Install NFS server (on Debian 12)
First, install the nfs server package
```bash
sudo aptitude install nfs-kernel-server
```

### Create the folder to share
Second, create the folder you wanna share (mine at `/home/nfs`), and make sure users have read/write access.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/nfs
cd /home
sudo chmod 777 nfs
```

Make an symbolic link in folder `exports` (optional).
```bash
cd /exports
sudo ln -s /home/nfs
```

### Edit `/etc/exports` file
Edit the `/etc/exports` file, and append the following at the end with XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX of the client IP:
```
/exports/nfs XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX(rw,sync)
```

### Apply the changes
Run the command below to apply the changes
```
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```


## On the client
### Create a folder to mount the NFS
Create a folder to mount the NFS (mine in folder `/mnt/net/`)
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/net/nfs1
```

### Mount the NFS onto the folder
Now, you may mount the NFS to your local machine
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs HHH.OOO.SSS.TTT:/exports/nfs /mnt/net/nfs1
```

If you wanna to umount the NFS, do
```bash
sudo umount /mnt/net/nsf1
```

### Mount the NFS on startup
Edit the `/etc/fstab` file to automatically mount the file system, and append the following to the end
```
HHH.OOO.SSS.TTT:/exports/nfs    /mnt/net/nfs1    nfs    defaults    0    0
```
