## Generate the public and private key pairs
First, generate the ssh keys using the ed25519 algoirthm:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
```

Then, follow the promote and save the key pairs, and the default is id_rsa. Here it is recommended to use the default name; if you really need to specify this, you'd better name it as somthing like "id_rsa_*" so that the system recognize it.

## Copy the public key file to the target machine
Now, you need to copy the public key file to the target machine. There are a few ways for this:

- You may create a new id_rsa.pub file in the .ssh folder in the home directory of the target machine, and copy and paste the content of you own *.pub file to the new file
- `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p portnumber wyujie@ip.of.target` (here replace the portnumber with actual port number, or ignore it if the port number is default)
- You may also use the sftp protocal to upload the public key file

Note that the file name needs to start with id_rsa for the system to recognize it automatically.
