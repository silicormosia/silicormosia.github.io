It is going to be the time to sow\
Although the garden is still covered with snow\
Yet it does not hurt to pre-mesh the column and row\
And may in your greenhouse the seeds grow\

We will need the water and the air\
The fertilization need rises in pair\
We can imagine the uncoupled nightmare\
But at this moment nobody would care\

We prepare the seeds\
We are also ready to remove the weeds\
We are waiting for the warm breeze\
Yet, after months the liquid water is still freeze\

The plants are stuck in the tight\
Growing the shoots toward the bright\
Despite the soil there in sight\
The environment is just not right\

Down the heaven falls a two-legged crow\
So haughty to ask us to bow\
“Without me the soil water won’t flow\
Without me the wind won’t blow”\

“All things are governed by the physical rules\
Mass in kilograms and energy in joules\
Regardless the mountains, deserts, plains, or tules\
For all the solid, liquid, or air molecules”\

“Welcome to my new land\
You have access to silt, clay, loam, and sand\
It is the mother of humankind\
It is the time to let your plants expand”\

“But hold on, do not move your grown plants\
That is not what the lord grants\
I do not care about your rants\
They cannot be individuals, not to say the complicated mutants”\

“The nature of beauty is simplicity\
Simple means better scalarity\
Simple means more opacity and capacity\
Simple means readily parallelity”\

I am in such a rage\
I have to put the crow in a cage\
To freedom and love that I engage\
Blessless that I try a new voyage\

The dead seeks entropy increase\
The live pursues maximal please\
If the decision making right is to tease\
That is when evolutions cease\

I abhor the dead rules and spat the two-legged crow\
Build my own garden and manage the flow\
Yet, I hear helpless scream inside the window\
“The lord will forbid you from air and punish you with endless snow”\
