May I have your attention, please?\
May I have your attention, please?\
Will the real land modeler please sign up?\
I repeat\
Will the real land modeler please sign up?\
We’re gonna have a problem\

Y’all act like you never seen a plant physiologist before\
Scorning behind the door like an monkey watching an kitten learning to roar\
And pretended applauding in public more appreciatively than before\

They eventually were to fight, writing worst reviews (Agh)\
In the follow of the “Oh, wait, no way, are you kidding\
He didn’t just do what I think he should, did he?”\
And the editor said\
Nothing, you idiots, the editor is not on your side, he is kidnapped by the reviewer 2 (Ha-ha)\

Researchers love Land models\
“Chicka-chicka-chicka, land modelers, I appreciate that\
Look at them, sitting in front of four monitors, typing their you-know-what\
Coding the equations from the you-know-who”, “Yeah, but they are useful though”\

Yeah, we probably wrote too many equations for people to understand\
But no more than the useless sentences from your copy-paste command\
Sometimes we want to teach you how an argument should stand\
But can’t, as the technical details are not meant for job or grant\

“Your manuscripts are in my folders, your manuscripts are in my folders”\
And if I am unhappy, you might just get direct rejects\
And that’s the message we deliver to young scientists\
And expect the reviewers do not know what the model is\
Of course, they’re gonna know when the word is\

By the time they hit the deadline, they’ve got email alerts, don’t they?\
We ain’t nothin’ but doctors\
Well, some of us parasites who bleed others like leeches\
But if we all revenge others with rejects and lack of novelties\
Then there’s no way to promote science or technology advances\

But if you feel what I feel, I got the antidote\
Guys, throw away your keyboards, single the chorus, and it goes\

I’m Land modeler, yes, I am a real modeler\
All you sick reviewers are just toddlers\
So won’t the real land modelers please sign up\
Please sign up, please sign up?\
‘Cause I’m Land modeler, yes, I’m a real modeler\
All you sick reviewers are just toddlers\
So won’t the real land modelers please sign up\
Please sign up, please sign up?\
