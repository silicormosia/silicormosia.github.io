The research centered on observations including plant physiology (methods and physiology), ecology (form and function), and data mining (remote sensing and meta analysis); whereas the research centered on modeling include optimality theory (organ and plant levels), vegetation modeling (plant and ecosystem levels), and Earth system modeling (regional and global scales)."
